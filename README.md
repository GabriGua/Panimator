### Trasparency
*AI helped me with this, how?*<br>
I used Github Copilot in "ask" mode only, whenever I didn't find a solution online.


for what?

- Canvas Rendering (sometimes);
- Cursor Rendering in Canvas (sometimes);
- Tools Pixel Size (sometimes);
- Frame Creation and Selection System (often, I had to re-adapt everything);
- Pixel Perfect (often, it was hard);
- Frame re-numeration (just the syntax);
- Exporting as a GIF (just to explain how to make it work);
- Making a ZIP file (same as GIF);
- Making the Import / Export of a project work (the import was a mess of errors)
- Making a smooth transition in js for the Tutorial (I rarely animated in js)
- Making a Drag and Drop system to re-positioning frames (just to know how this system should have worked)
- Making the onion skin work ( had to understand how to make it work with a canvas)
- Debugging (rarely);

In some occasion used autocomplete just to speed up repetitive tasks.
